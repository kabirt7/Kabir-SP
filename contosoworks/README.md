# Human resources hub

## Template content

- Hub site with custom content
- Secondary site collection associated to the hub site
- Multiple custom modern pages and news articles
- Example Office documents

**Notice** - If applied on top of existing communication site, welcome page content will be overridden.

**Note** - There might be small differences between the screenshot from the [SharePoint look book](https://spdesign.azurewebsites.net) and the end results of the template. Template automation will get you as close as possible given certain API level limitations. Templates are also designed to be as independent as possible, which has resulted some compromises on the implementation.

## Prerequisites

- You will need to be a site collection administrator to be able to deploy this solution with permissions to create new site collections, unless you apply it on top of an existing site
